 * This class implements a simple way to keep track of which world
 * is currently active. Other objects that need to keep a reference
 * to the active world will keep instead a reference to a CurrentWorld
 * object. This object will be always the same during the execution of
 * the program.
 * 
 * When a reference to the current world is needed, a
 * call to getWorld() will return it. This reference should be used and
 * discarded.
 * 
 * An object can implement the interface CurrentWorldChangeListener
 * and register as listener to a CurrentWorld object. After that, this
 * object will be notified every time that the world changes.
 * 
 * A CurrentWorld is also a TimeListener. When it receive a tick it
 * delegates the tick to the active world. This way, it isn't necessary
 * to remove an old world and add the new one as listener to the Timer
 * every time the active world changes.
